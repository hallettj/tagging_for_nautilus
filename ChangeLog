Version 1.3:

File names are now read from NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS
instead of from ARGV. This is a better method since the full path for
each file is included, which was not the case with ARGV. This fixes a
bug that caused the tagging scripts to not work when run on files
selected directly from the Desktop.

The names of the scripts have been changed to be more readable. All of
the names are now prefixed with "Tagging:" so that they will appear
together in the scripts menu. 

The output of Show Tags has been changed to be more clear when there
are no tags to show. Instead of an empty dialog there is a message
explaining that there are no tags to show.

I also fixed a typo in the ChangeLog. The entry for version 1.2 was
mistakenly labeled version 2.2.

Version 1.2:

The bug fixed in version 1.1 wasn't actually entirely fixed. It was fixed
in this version by adding quotes around filenames in system calls.

Version 1.1:

Fixed a bug in show-tags and remove-tags that prevented tags from
displaying if they were attached to files with spaces in their names.
