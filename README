Nautilus scripts for tagging support using Tracker
Version 1.3

Tracker must be installed and running. See
http://www.gnome.org/projects/tracker/ for information about what
Tracker is and how to get it.

These scripts allow you to add tags to files, remove tags from files,
and to display tags associated with files from within Nautilus.

To install, copy add-tags, show-tags, and remove-tags to
~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/

To add tags: 
 1. select one or more files
 2. open a context menu by right clicking on one of the selected files
 3. open the "Scripts" sub-menu
 4. click on "add-tags"
 5. Type some tags separated by commas into the box that appears and
 press "OK"

To view tags:
 1. select one or more files
 2. open a context menu by right clicking on one of the selected files
 3. open the "Scripts" sub-menu
 4. click on "show-tags"

 If you have selected more than one file, the dialog box that appears
 will only show tags that are common to all of the selected files.

 There is a known bug that prevents this script from displaying tags
 with spaces in them correctly. It will incorrectly report a
 multi-word tag as a collection of separate tags. See
 http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=464549

To remove tags:
 1. select one or more files
 2. open a context menu by right clicking on one of the selected files
 3. open the "Scripts" sub-menu
 4. click on "remove-tags"
 5. check the boxes next to the tags that you want to remove and click
 "OK"

 The remove dialog will show all of the tags attached to every file
 that is selected. The selected tags will be removed from every file
 that has that tag.

 The same bug that prevents multi-word tags from displaying correctly
 prevents this script from being able to delete those tags. You will
 have to use tracker-search-tool or tracker-tag from the command line
 to remove any tags that have spaces in them.
